# MODEP-Scripting
A repository of bash scripts that configure [MODEP](https://blokas.io/modep/) pedalboards. 

## load-nam.sh
Intended for use with [Neural Amp Modeler](https://www.neuralampmodeler.com/).

Loads .nam models from an external memory device to the last used pedalboard. 

**TO-DO**: test on more Raspberry Pis. Pull requests are appreciated.
